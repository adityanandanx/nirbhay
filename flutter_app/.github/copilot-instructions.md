Constructors for public widgets must have a named 'key' parameter. Always add a named parameter to the constructor. Parameter 'key' must be a super parameter. Always convert 'key' to a super parameter.

A value for optional parameter 'key' isn't ever given.
Always keep in mind the app_theme.dart file when styling components.
