# Nirbhay Flutter App - BLE Integration Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ Successfully Implemented BLE Functionality

The Flutter safety companion app now has full BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) integration with ESP32-S3 devices!

### âœ… What's Working

1. **BLE Service** (`lib/services/ble_service.dart`)

   - Device scanning and discovery
   - Connection management
   - Data streaming from ESP32-S3
   - Automatic reconnection handling

2. **BLE Connection Screen** (`lib/screens/ble_connection_screen.dart`)

   - Device discovery interface
   - Connection status display
   - Real-time data visualization
   - Connection management controls

3. **Home Screen Integration** (`lib/screens/dashboard/home_screen.dart`)

   - Real-time wearable status
   - Dynamic connection state display
   - Quick access to BLE connection screen
   - Visual feedback for connection state

4. **Android Configuration**
   - All required Bluetooth permissions added
   - Core library desugaring enabled
   - Compatible SDK versions set
   - NDK version updated for dependencies

### ðŸ”§ Key Features

- **Device Discovery**: Scan for nearby ESP32-S3 devices
- **Auto-Connect**: Automatically connect to "Nirbhay_Device"
- **Real-time Data**: Stream sensor data (heart rate, temperature, battery)
- **Emergency Alerts**: Handle emergency button presses from wearable
- **Connection Management**: Connect, disconnect, and manage device status
- **Visual Feedback**: Dynamic UI updates based on connection state

### ðŸ“± How to Use

1. **From Home Screen**:

   - View wearable status in the Smart Bracelet card
   - Tap "Connect Device" to open BLE connection screen
   - See real-time connection status

2. **From BLE Connection Screen**:
   - Tap "Start Scanning" to search for devices
   - Select "Nirbhay_Device" from the list
   - Tap "Connect" to establish connection
   - View real-time sensor data when connected

### ðŸ”§ ESP32-S3 Setup

Refer to `ESP32_SETUP.md` for:

- Complete Arduino code for ESP32-S3
- Hardware wiring instructions
- Arduino IDE setup
- Testing procedures
- Troubleshooting guide

### ðŸš€ Next Steps

The BLE functionality is now complete and ready for testing with actual ESP32-S3 hardware. The app will:

1. Automatically discover ESP32-S3 devices broadcasting as "Nirbhay_Device"
2. Connect and establish communication
3. Display real-time sensor data
4. Handle emergency alerts from the wearable device
5. Maintain connection status in the home screen
